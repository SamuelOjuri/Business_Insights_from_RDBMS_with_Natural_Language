# KaggleX-Final-Project: Deriving Business Insights from Relational Database Management Systems with Natural Language

As recent advancements make it easier to leverage the use of Large Language Models in business solutions, the potential for widespread adoption of this approach is increasingly promising. Most organizations across several industries store their data about business processes and transactions in Relational Database Management Systems. Retrieving business-critical insights from these data stores has the limitation of technical expertise in Structured Query Language (SQL). The project aims to provide a solution that enables non-technical stakeholders to easily query databases using natural language and retrieve insights about business key performance indicators and opportunities in real-time. The solution allows appropriate non-technical stakeholders to use natural language for retrieving desired information from their RDBMS and also access advanced data analytics reports and dashboards derived from their queries using an intelligent agent and a competent large language model within an integrated framework.
